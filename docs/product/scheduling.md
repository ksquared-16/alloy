# Scheduling

## Purpose

Describe **`schedules`** lifecycle in admin and public flows: assignment, cancellation, reschedule, and links to jobs/opportunities.

## Current state

- **`schedules`** table with org scope; status definitions treat `schedules` as an admin entity type.
- Admin routes include **`web/app/api/admin/schedules/[id]/assign/route.ts`**, **`cancel/route.ts`**, **`reschedule/route.ts`** — typically check allowed status keys via **`assertAllowedStatusKey`** patterns.
- **Action links:** `consume-reschedule` and related routes update schedule rows consistent with workflow expectations (see comments in `web/app/api/action-links/consume-reschedule/route.ts`).
- **Workspace:** Department hooks fetch “today” schedules via **`/api/admin/schedules`** (`useDepartmentQueueData.ts`).
- **Needs verification:** Dedicated attendance, punch clock, or staffing models beyond schedule rows — grep showed thin coverage; may be vertical-specific or not yet implemented.

## How it works

1. Schedule created/updated through booking or admin flows.
2. Status transitions validated against org definitions.
3. Customer/vendor interactions may consume **action links** → **events** → **workflow** updates.

## Source of truth / key files

| Concern | Location |
|---------|-----------|
| Schedule admin APIs | `web/app/api/admin/schedules/**` |
| Schedule overview labels | `web/lib/admin/scheduleOverviewLabels.ts`, `web/lib/admin/scheduleRecordSnapshot.ts` |
| Status rules | `web/lib/admin/statusTransitionRules.ts` |
| Department data hook | `web/hooks/useDepartmentQueueData.ts` |

## Guardrails

- **Do not** change schedule times without working through validated APIs (timezone + org local day bounds matter — see `web/lib/admin/orgLocalDayBounds.ts`, `timezoneContract`).
- **Do not** bypass workflows where reschedule reasons or notifications are workflow-owned.

## Known gaps / risks

- **Needs verification:** Complete cross-vertical scheduling UX (field services vs childcare).
- **Needs verification:** Labor compliance / attendance feature depth.

## When this doc must be updated

New schedule states, workforce features, or calendar integration changes.
