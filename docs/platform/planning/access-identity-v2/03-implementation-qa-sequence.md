Workstreams are `W-n`. Invariants `I-n` and divergences (`C-n`, `G-n`) are phase 2 and phase 1 references.
Sizing is **S** ≤ 2 engineer-days · **M** 3–8 · **L** 9–20. These are estimates on a codebase of 539 API
routes and 289 migrations, not commitments.

## 1. What determines the order

Phase 2 §13 offered a suggested order. This plan keeps its logic and adds the three constraints that actually
bind — each of which reorders work relative to a naive severity ranking.

### 1.1 Fail-open cannot be closed before the invariant it depends on holds

The tempting first move is I-19 — *absent scope denies*. Shipping it first would deny **every membership
created through the product since the backfill migration**, because G4 confirms none of them has a profile row
(`web/app/api/admin/users/route.ts:102-106` inserts into `user_roles` only). A fail-open default cannot be
flipped to fail-closed until the data it reads exists. That is three ordered steps, not one:

```
  create path writes a profile   →   backfill the existing gap   →   flip the default to deny
        (W-5, I-18)                      (W-6, migration)                (W-7, I-19)
```

The same shape recurs: **make the new source of truth true, prove it is true, then depend on it.** It governs
W-13 (portal capability), W-16 (role FK) and W-20 (legacy fallback) identically.

### 1.2 Evidence about live data gates four changes, so it comes first

Four workstreams have an unknown blast radius that only the deployed database can resolve:

- **G1** — whether the `handle_new_user()` trigger is attached at all is *not visible in version control*
  (phase 1 G1). Its answer changes whether the legacy fallback is a live escalation path or dead code.
- **W-20** — how many principals authorize *only* through the legacy fallback. If non-zero, deleting it locks
  them out.
- **W-16** — how many `user_roles.role` values have no matching `role_definitions` row. Since that column is
  unconstrained text (C2), the FK will reject them.
- **W-13** — whether every org holding an `admin`/`ops` membership also has the corresponding
  `role_definitions` row. If not, granting `portal.access` per role definition silently misses that org and
  locks it out.

None of these is answerable statically, and each is cheap to answer read-only. **Wave 0 is five SELECT
statements**, and it is the highest-leverage step in the programme.

### 1.3 Declaring a capability per route is worthless until the vocabulary is settled

I-24's declared `(route → capability)` table is the mechanism that converts I-17 from an audit into a build
check, and it is the largest single item here (539 routes). Building it before I-13 settles which keys exist
means declaring keys that are then renamed or deleted — the sweep would be done twice. Vocabulary first,
declaration second, enforcement sweep third.

The corollary is that the **big** work is late and the **risky** work is early. That is deliberate: the early
waves change behaviour in ways that can lock people out and must be done under close attention; the late waves
are large but mechanical and safely parallelizable.

---

## 2. The lockout class

Four workstreams can deny every operator access to the product if they land wrong:

| # | Workstream | Failure mode if it lands wrong |
|---|---|---|
| **L1** | W-7 — absent scope denies | Any membership without a profile row is denied all rows |
| **L2** | W-13 — portal admission becomes a capability | Any principal not granted `portal.access` is redirected to `/unauthorized` |
| **L3** | W-16 — FK on `user_roles.role` | Migration fails, or existing memberships become unwritable |
| **L4** | W-20 — legacy fallback removed | Principals authorizing via `user_profiles`/`app_users` lose all authority |

All four are the same shape — *a widening default is replaced by an explicit source of truth* — so all four
use one ritual rather than four bespoke plans.

### The four-step switch ritual

1. **Seed.** Write the new source of truth for all existing subjects, in its own migration, under the §11
   preflight gate. This migration changes no behaviour: nothing reads the new data yet.
2. **Dual-read and observe.** Ship the resolver computing *both* the old and new answers, enforcing the **old**
   one, and recording every divergence with the `(principal, org)` pair and both results. Divergences are a
   defect list, not noise.
3. **Prove zero.** The switch is authorized only on evidence of **zero unexplained divergences** across a
   stated observation window and the full fixture matrix (§10.3). A non-zero count means step 1 was incomplete
   — return to it; do not add an exception.
4. **Switch and remove.** Enforce the new answer. Delete the old path and its constant in the *same* commit —
   a dormant fallback is what phase 1 §2.1 is about.

Steps 2–3 are what make these changes ordinary instead of frightening. The cost is one extra deploy per
workstream; the alternative is discovering the gap from a locked-out operator.

**Revert path.** Each of L1–L4 must be revertible by a single feature-flag flip or a one-line revert of the
step-4 commit, without a migration rollback. Step 1's migration is additive precisely so that reverting the
code never requires reverting data.

---

## 3. Wave map and critical path

| Wave | Theme | Workstreams | Gated on |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | Facts before changes — read-only live verification | W-0 | — |
| **1** | Fail-closed quick wins, no schema | W-1 … W-4 | — |
| **2** | The scope invariant (the confirmed fail-open) | W-5 … W-8 | W-0 |
| **3** | One catalog, one vocabulary | W-9 … W-12 | — (parallel with 2) |
| **4** | Admission and declaration | W-13 … W-15 | W-3, D2 |
| **5** | Role-model coherence and the long tail | W-16 … W-22 | W-0, D3, D4 |

Waves 2 and 3 touch disjoint surfaces — scope tables and route handlers versus catalog tables and the grid —
and can run concurrently by different people. Waves 4 and 5 both depend on wave 3.

**Critical path** (longest dependency chain):

```
W-0  →  W-9 (one catalog)  →  W-11 (one vocabulary)  →  W-13 (portal.access)  →  W-14 (route table)  →  W-15 (enforcement sweep)
 S            M                      M                        M                        M                       L
```

Everything else fits beside it. W-15 is the single largest item and the one most amenable to being split
across contributors once W-14's mechanism exists.

---

## 4. Wave 0 — Facts before changes

### W-0 — Live authority census *(S · read-only · no product change)*

Five read-only queries against the deployed database. Produces a JSON evidence file; changes nothing.

| # | Question | Query | Gates |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Is `handle_new_user()` attached? | `SELECT tgname, tgenabled FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgrelid = 'auth.users'::regclass;` | G1, W-20 |
| Q2 | How many principals authorize *only* via the legacy fallback? | memberships in `user_profiles`/`app_users` with role, having **no** `user_roles` row | W-20 (L4) |
| Q3 | How many `user_roles.role` values have no `role_definitions` row for that org? | anti-join `user_roles` → `role_definitions` on `(org_id, role_key)` | W-16 (L3) |
| Q4 | How many memberships lack an access profile? | anti-join `user_roles` → `user_access_profiles` on `(user_id, org_id)` | W-6 (L1) |
| Q5 | Does every org with an `admin`/`ops` membership have the matching `role_definitions` row? | per-org anti-join | W-13 (L2) |

Q3 and Q5 are the same anti-join read two ways, and together they are the reason W-13 is not a one-line
change: `user_roles.role` is unconstrained text, so a membership can name a role the org never defined.

**Exit criteria.** `qa/access-identity-v2/w0-live-census.json` committed, with counts and the query text for
each of Q1–Q5. Every one of L1–L4 cites it before proceeding.

**If Q2, Q3, Q4 or Q5 is non-zero**, the corresponding workstream gains a *remediation* step ahead of its
switch, and that step is scheduled explicitly rather than absorbed. A non-zero Q1 (trigger attached) promotes
G1 from latent to live and moves W-20 into wave 2.

---

## 5. Wave 1 — Fail-closed quick wins

No schema, no migration, small blast radius, each independently revertible. This wave exists to close the one
*confirmed* exposure and the two operator-visible defects while wave 0's evidence is being gathered.

### W-1 — Gate the six analytics routes *(S · I-17, I-23 · closes G2)*

Six routes gate on `access.ok` alone, making org-wide metrics readable by any authenticated member of the org
— including `regional_lead` and `school_director`, the two personas the portal refuses to admit:

```
web/app/api/admin/intelligence/operational/route.ts:26-29
web/app/api/admin/metrics/resolve/route.ts:83-84
web/app/api/admin/metrics/trends/route.ts:47-48
web/app/api/admin/analytics/metrics/[id]/trend/route.ts:40-41
web/app/api/admin/analytics/metrics/[id]/preview/route.ts:31-32
web/app/api/admin/analytics/metrics/[id]/snapshot/route.ts:23-24
```

Add the portal gate each already implies, and declare the capability each requires. `configuration/programs/route.ts:54-55,65`
is the reference shape — it is the seventh route in the raw difference and is correctly gated by permission.

**QA.** Tier B unit, per route: an access context that is `ok` but not `portalEligible` receives 403. Extend
the fixture idiom in `web/tests/admin/usersRolesAuth.test.ts:6-19`. New file
`web/tests/access/analyticsRouteGates.test.ts`.
**Exit.** Six tests red before the change, green after. Regression lock RL-1 (§13).

### W-2 — Self-elevation ban *(S · I-11 · partially closes G3)*

`PATCH /api/admin/users/[userId]/role` applies no self-assignment guard. The full subset rule is D3-dependent
and deferred to W-18; **the self-elevation ban is not** — no reading of D3 permits a principal to modify its
own authority.

**QA.** Tier B: caller `userId` === target `userId` → 403, for every role value including the caller's current
one. Tier C: an integration case asserting the row is unchanged after the denial.
**Exit.** A principal cannot alter its own membership through any product path.

### W-3 — Repair the unsavable grid row *(S · I-14 precursor · closes C5)*

`permissionGrid.ts:23` offers `workflows.read`/`workflows.write`, seeded into no catalog table, so toggling it
returns HTTP 400 and **takes the operator's other valid selections on that screen with it**
(`grants/route.ts:61-67`, validation before the delete-all-then-insert at `:70-89`).

The keys exist one namespace away — `ops.workflows.read`/`ops.workflows.write` (`remote_schema.sql:731-732`).
Two candidate fixes: point the grid row at the legacy keys, or seed the bare keys. **Point the grid row at the
existing keys** — seeding new keys adds a fourth vocabulary variant to the problem W-11 exists to remove, and
W-10 deletes this hand-maintained list entirely.

This is a stop-the-bleeding fix with a two-week life. It is worth doing anyway: it is one line, and the failure
it prevents destroys operator input.

**QA.** Tier B: every key named by `PERMISSION_GRID_ROWS` exists in the catalog seed. Extend
`web/tests/admin/permissionGrid.test.ts`. This assertion becomes structurally unnecessary at W-10 and must be
*replaced*, not deleted, by the projection test.
**Exit.** No grid row names an unseeded key; a full-grid save round-trips.

### W-4 — Service-client principal check *(M · I-3 · addresses G6)*

517 of 539 route files hold a service-role client. I-3 requires every one to resolve and gate a principal
separately. This workstream builds the **check**, not the remediation: a static verification that every file
importing a service-role client also resolves a principal, plus a reviewed, named allow-list for the legitimate
exceptions (health checks, webhooks, public intake — the 28 tier-0 routes phase 1 classified by family).

Remediation of whatever the check finds is W-15's sweep, sized there.

**QA.** Tier A build-time check. Fails on any new file that imports `supabaseAdmin` without resolving a
principal and without an allow-list entry carrying a reason.
**Exit.** The check runs in CI and the exception list is a reviewed artifact rather than a residue. **The
initial count of exceptions is recorded as the baseline for W-15 and is expected to be large** — this
workstream's value is that the number stops growing silently.

---

## 6. Wave 2 — The scope invariant

The one *confirmed, fail-open* defect in the system, and the L1 lockout. Depends on W-0 Q4.

### W-5 — Create a profile row with every membership *(M · I-18 · closes G4)*

`POST /api/admin/users` inserts into `user_roles` and references no scope table
(`web/app/api/admin/users/route.ts:102-106`). Every membership the product has created since the backfill
migration is unscoped.

Membership creation and profile creation **MUST** be one transaction. Doing this in application code across
two Supabase inserts is not a transaction; this workstream therefore introduces an RPC (or equivalent) that
writes both atomically, and routes every membership-creating path through it.

Audit for *other* membership writers before implementing — the phase 1 inventory audited the create route, not
the full set of writers. Any path found gets the same RPC.

**QA.**
- Tier B: the create handler calls the atomic path; a failure in the profile write fails the whole call.
- Tier C integration (`web/tests/access/membershipProfileInvariant.integration.test.ts`, guarded with
  `describe.skipIf(!hasEnv)` per `web/tests/admin/verticalBootstrap.integration.test.ts:12-18`): create a
  membership through the product path, assert exactly one profile row exists; simulate profile-write failure,
  assert no orphan membership row.

**Exit.** Q4's count cannot grow. This is the precondition for W-6 being a bounded, one-time job.

### W-6 — Backfill profiles for existing memberships *(S · migration · shared → preflight)*

One additive migration creating a profile row for every membership lacking one, at the scope the resolver
currently infers — both dimensions `all` — so **behaviour is unchanged by construction**. This is step 1 of the
ritual for L1.

Preflight per §11: count of rows to be created must equal W-0 Q4; zero memberships left uncovered afterwards;
no existing profile row modified.

**QA.** Tier A: post-apply anti-join returns zero. Evidence file per §11.
**Exit.** Every membership has exactly one profile row, and W-0 Q4 re-run returns 0.

### W-7 — Absent scope denies *(M · I-19 · lockout class L1)*

Flip `resolveAdminAccessCore.ts:152-161` from "missing profile ⇒ both scopes `all`" to deny, and delete the
comment that calls it a legacy transition.

Full ritual: W-6 seeds (done), then dual-read — resolve both answers, enforce the old, log every principal for
whom they differ. **A divergence after W-5 and W-6 means a membership was created outside the atomic path**,
which is exactly the defect worth finding before the switch, not after.

**QA.**
- Tier C: delete a profile row for a fixture principal, assert denial rather than `all`.
- Tier C: the same principal with a profile row present is unaffected.
- Tier D: one authenticated browser pass on `:3020` confirming a normally-configured operator is unaffected.
**Exit.** Zero divergences across the observation window; switch commit removes the fallback branch.

### W-8 — No role widens a scope dimension *(M · I-20 · closes C8)*

`portalAdminBypassesDepartmentScope` forces `departmentScope = "all"` for `admin`/`ops`
(`accessScope.ts:45,51-53`). Since only `admin`/`ops` reach the portal, **every principal who can use the
product bypasses department scope** — the dimension is configurable, displayed, and inert.

Deleting the bypass without preparation would restrict administrators who are configured as restricted but
have never experienced it. W-6 has already written `all` for every backfilled membership, so for those the
removal is a no-op. The exposed set is principals with an explicit `department_scope = 'restricted'` profile
*and* an `admin`/`ops` role — today those principals are silently unrestricted. **That count is a sixth Wave 0
query in practice; add it to W-0 if W-8 is scheduled.**

**QA.** Tier B: `effectiveDepartmentScopeDimensions` returns the stored scope for every role, with the
existing suite in `web/tests/admin/adminAccessScope.test.ts` extended rather than replaced. Tier C: an `admin`
with `department_scope = restricted` sees only allowed departments.
**Exit.** No role literal appears in `accessScope.ts`; department scope is enforced for all roles.

---

## 7. Wave 3 — One catalog, one vocabulary

Disjoint from wave 2; runs in parallel. This is where the permission model stops being three models.

### W-9 — Consolidate to one catalog *(M · migration · I-12 · closes C3)*

Three catalog tables — `permission_keys`, `permissions`, `permission_definitions` — and
`role_permission_grants.permission_key` carrying **two foreign keys on the same column with different
`ON DELETE` semantics** (`remote_schema.sql:6503,6508`), while the write API validates against the third
(`grants/route.ts:61-67`).

Choose one survivor, migrate grants to a single FK, retire the others. Which survives is an implementation
choice; that only one survives is not. Sequence the retirement as *stop writing* → *verify no reader* →
*drop*, with the drop in a later migration than the repoint.

**Preflight is mandatory and non-trivial** — per §11 item 3, every grant row must satisfy the surviving FK
*after* any preparatory inserts, and per item 4 the dropped tables must have no unexpected incoming FKs or
dependent views. Phase 1 records that migrations already hand-maintain all three
(`20260505120100_settings_users_roles_permission.sql:4-7`); the union across them is the preflight's subject.

**QA.** Tier A schema assertion: `pg_constraint` shows exactly one FK on `role_permission_grants.permission_key`
and exactly one catalog table. Tier C: grant, revoke, and read-back round-trip through the API.
**Exit.** One table, one FK, and the API validates against the same table the FK names.

### W-10 — The grid becomes a projection *(M · I-14 · closes C5 structurally)*

`PERMISSION_GRID_ROWS` (`permissionGrid.ts:12-24`) is an independent hand-maintained list. Derive it from the
catalog so a row naming a non-existent key is **impossible by construction** rather than caught by review.

This modifies an existing operator surface to be truthful. It is explicitly **not** a rebuild of the
Users/Roles settings experience (§14.1).

**QA.** Tier A: no literal permission-key list exists in UI source. Tier B: the projection over a fixture
catalog produces the expected rows, and W-3's assertion is replaced by a generation test.
**Exit.** Adding a key to the catalog surfaces it in the grid with no UI change; removing one removes the row.

### W-11 — One vocabulary *(M · I-13 · closes C4)*

Three disjoint vocabularies: the legacy `ops.*`/`fin.*` seed set, the grid's `crm.*`/`settings.*` set, and the
per-feature keys that are actually enforced. **4 of the grid's 20 keys are enforced; 13 enforced keys have no
grid row.** An operator cannot grant most of what the platform enforces, and most of what the UI offers changes
nothing.

Two directions, both required: enforced-but-ungrantable keys gain catalog rows (and therefore grid rows, via
W-10); catalog-but-unenforced keys are **deleted, not left in the grid** (phase 2 §7.2's deletion rule).

Deletion is the contentious half. A key that nothing checks is not a permission — but an operator may have
toggled it and believe it means something. **Deletions must be enumerated and shown to the operator before the
migration runs**, not discovered afterward. That list is an exit artifact.

**QA.** Tier A: set difference between catalog keys and keys named in declared route capabilities is empty in
both directions. This check is only meaningful after W-14 supplies the declared set — so W-11 lands the data
change and W-14 lands the check that keeps it true. State this dependency rather than claiming W-11 is
self-verifying.
**Exit.** Enumerated deletion list reviewed; catalog and enforced set reconciled; the residual gap is a written
number, not an unknown.

### W-12 — Seeds enumerate their grants *(S · I-15 · closes G5)*

`seed_default_rbac()` grants `admin` *every active row* in `permission_keys` and `ops` all but two
(`remote_schema.sql:748-760`). Because that table holds every vocabulary, the blanket widens whenever any
migration seeds a key — including keys added by W-11.

Rewrite to enumerate. Per §11 item 5, preflight must confirm **catalog width vs live**: a new tenant must not
receive a thinner set than today without that narrowing being the intended, reviewed change.

**QA.** Tier A: no `SELECT` over the catalog inside a grant seed. Tier C: a freshly seeded org has exactly the
enumerated grants.
**Exit.** Grant seeds are a readable list; adding a catalog key grants nothing implicitly.

---

## 8. Wave 4 — Admission and declaration

### W-13 — Portal admission becomes a capability *(M · I-16 · lockout class L2 · closes C6 · needs D2)*

`PORTAL_ROLES = {admin, ops}` (`resolveAdminAccessCore.ts:18`) is consumed as a boolean by every tier-2 gate.
The platform seeds four system roles per org and can admit two of them; a `regional_lead` is redirected to
`/unauthorized` (`web/app/adminV2/layout.tsx:23-30`) no matter what it is granted.

Introduce `portal.access` as a catalog key, granted to the roles that hold admission today. Seeding it to
`admin` and `ops` reproduces current behaviour **exactly**, which is what makes this a behaviour-preserving
refactor rather than a policy change. What D2 decides is whether `regional_lead` and `school_director` also
receive it — that is a grant, not a code change, which is the entire point of I-16.

**The L2 hazard is W-0 Q5.** Granting per `role_definitions` row misses any org whose memberships name
`admin`/`ops` without a corresponding definition row — possible because `user_roles.role` is unconstrained text
(C2). Such an org would lose portal access entirely at step 4. Q5 must be zero, or remediated first.

Full ritual: seed grants (migration, preflight) → dual-read `portalEligible` from both the constant and the
capability, enforcing the constant, logging divergence → prove zero → switch and delete `PORTAL_ROLES`.

Phase 2 §6.2 notes `admin`/`ops` are special in at least three unrelated places — `PORTAL_ROLES`,
`ALLOWED_ROLES` (`web/lib/adminAuth.ts`), and `PORTAL_DEPARTMENT_SCOPE_BYPASS_ROLES` (`accessScope.ts:51-53`).
W-8 removes the third. **W-13 must remove the second as well as the first**, or the switch leaves a second
hard-coded admission set live.

**QA.**
- Tier B: `portalEligible` is true iff the capability is present, across a role matrix including a custom role
  granted `portal.access` and an `admin` denied it.
- Tier C: grant/revoke `portal.access` and assert admission changes without a deploy.
- Tier D: browser pass on `:3020` for an admitted and a refused principal — route, expected vs observed,
  console errors, evidence path per the slot's UI verification rules.
**Exit.** No role literal governs admission; `PORTAL_ROLES` and `ALLOWED_ROLES` are deleted.

### W-14 — Declared route capability table *(M · I-24 · the mechanism)*

Every route declares the capability it requires as a **value**, not a condition in its body, so the
`(route → capability)` set is enumerable by a build-time check rather than by grep. Routes legitimately
requiring none declare `capability: null` **with a stated reason**, making "no gate" an auditable assertion.

This is the direct answer to C1: a grep census over-reported enforcement by ~30× because *mentioning*
`permissionKeys` and *branching on* it are indistinguishable to a text search. `auditAuthorityPaths.mjs:37,103`
is the artifact — its `/permissionKeys\b/` primitive credited 440 routes to a module that only resolves and
returns the bundle.

Deliver the mechanism plus a pilot slice (the 17 genuinely gating routes and W-1's six), not the full sweep.

**QA.** Tier A build check: the table covers every route file under `web/app/api`; any route absent from it
fails the build. **Retire `auditAuthorityPaths.mjs` in this workstream** — leaving a known-30×-wrong census in
the repo invites someone to cite it.
**Exit.** The route table builds, covers 539 routes, and the tier census is replaced by a lookup.

### W-15 — Enforcement sweep *(L · I-17, I-23 · the long tail)*

Bring every route to the G-A…G-D gate contract, using W-14's declarations and W-4's exception baseline.
~500 admin routes currently gate on portal eligibility alone; 17 consult a capability.

Split by route family, one contributor per family, each family independently mergeable. **Publish the per-family
count in the plan of record as it lands** — a sweep that reports "mostly done" is how C1 happened.

**QA.** Tier A: the declared table shows zero routes with an unreviewed `null`. Tier C: per-family gate-order
tests at the boundary, asserting 401 before 403 before scope filtering — order matters, because a route that
checks capability before tenancy leaks the existence of other orgs' rows.
**Exit.** Every route's gate matches its declaration; the residual `null` set is reviewed and named.

---

## 9. Wave 5 — Role-model coherence

Independent of each other; schedule against W-0's evidence and the decisions.

### W-16 — FK on `user_roles.role` *(M · migration · I-8 · lockout class L3 · closes C2)*

Governance already claims this FK exists (`roles-and-permissions.md:20`); the constraint actually lives in one
application write path (`.../role/route.ts:27-30`). Make the claim true.

**Blocked on W-0 Q3.** Any `user_roles` row naming an undefined role fails the FK. Remediation — define the
role, or correct the row — is a separate, reviewed migration ahead of the constraint.

**QA.** Tier A schema: the FK exists. Tier C: inserting an undefined role fails at the database, not only in
the API.
**Exit.** Q3 = 0 and the constraint is enforced by the schema.

### W-17 — Multi-role write path *(M · I-10 · closes C7 · informed by D2)*

The composite PK exists specifically to allow "ops + regional_lead"
(`20260505120000_user_roles_composite_primary_key.sql:4`) and the resolver unions role keys into a set — but
the only assignment API deletes every row for `(user, org)` and inserts one (`.../role/route.ts:38-44`), as its
own docstring admits. The modelled capability is unreachable through the product.

Add and remove individual `(principal, org, role)` rows. Effective capability is the **union** — never
intersection, or role assignment stops being compositional.

**QA.** Tier B: union semantics over a multi-role fixture. Tier C: add a second role, assert both persist and
capability is the union; remove one, assert the other survives. Extend
`web/tests/admin/userRolesMembership.test.ts`.
**Exit.** A multi-role membership is reachable through the product.

### W-18 — Delegation ceiling *(M · I-11 · closes G3 · needs D3)*

W-2 shipped the self-elevation ban. This is the subset rule: when *A* assigns role *R* to *B*, *R*'s capability
set must be a subset of *A*'s. Without it, any `settings.users_roles` holder can mint an `admin` and every
permission model collapses to `admin`.

**QA.** Tier C: attempt to grant a capability the caller lacks → denied; grant one the caller holds → allowed.
Tier B: the subset computation over fixture capability sets, including the empty and identical cases.
**Exit.** D3 answered and encoded; no path grants authority the caller lacks.

### W-19 — RLS position *(S–M · closes C10, C9 · needs D4)*

Under D4(b) — the phase 2 recommendation — RLS is documented as defence-in-depth only, no new policy is
written as though it gates the product, and the dead `owner`/`manager` grants (85 occurrences, never seeded)
are removed. Under D4(a) it adopts `role_definitions` as its vocabulary and one privilege function, retiring
two of the three current definitions of "is this user privileged" (`has_org_role`, `is_admin`, and the
`user_profiles.role` policies at `remote_schema.sql:6795,6801,6807`).

The sizes differ by an order of magnitude. **D4 must be answered before this is scheduled, not before it
starts.**

**QA.** Under (b): a documented position plus a static check that no new policy references an unseeded role
literal. Under (a): coverage tests, sized separately.
**Exit.** One written position; the vocabulary in RLS matches the platform's, or is documented as not
authoritative.

### W-20 — Remove the legacy fallback *(M · I-1, I-2 · lockout class L4)*

Three tables can make someone `admin`/`ops`, and `app_users` is joined on either of two columns because the
linkage is itself ambiguous (`resolveAdminAccessCore.ts:44-68`, `remote_schema.sql:1010-1019`). Under the model
exactly one source is legal.

**Blocked on W-0 Q1 and Q2.** If Q2 > 0, those principals need real `user_roles` memberships first — a
remediation migration under §11, then the ritual. If Q1 shows the trigger attached, G1's default-to-`ops` is
live and this rises in priority.

**QA.** Tier B: a principal with no `user_roles` row resolves to no authority regardless of
`user_profiles`/`app_users` content. Tier A: no authority-path module reads either table.
**Exit.** One principal source; the fallback and its three queries are deleted.

### W-21 — Preview renders from the enforcing code *(S–M · I-22 · closes C11)*

`resolveAdminAccessDimensionsForOrgMember` (`resolveAdminAccessCore.ts:209-290`) recomputes the whole access
result for the operator-facing preview, and differs from runtime in both directions: no legacy fallback (shows
nothing for exactly the principals whose authority comes from it) and no department-scope bypass (shows an
`admin` as restricted when at runtime they are not).

**Schedule this after W-8 and W-20**, which delete both divergences at the source. Doing it earlier means
unifying against a resolver that is still changing; doing it after makes it close to a deletion.

**QA.** Tier C: preview and runtime resolve identically across the §10.3 fixture matrix — the same matrix,
asserted twice.
**Exit.** One resolver; the preview has no independent implementation.

### W-22 — Explicit org, no lexicographic tiebreak *(M · I-7)*

A principal with memberships in several orgs is collapsed to one — admin/ops rows win, else the
lexicographically smallest `org_id` (`resolveAdminAccessCore.ts:26-37`); roles in every other org are
discarded. Sorting UUIDs is a silent, unexplainable authority decision.

Authority resolves for an explicit `(principal, org)` pair, determined by the request. "Primary org" may
survive as a presentation default; it must not survive as an authority input.

Also covers **I-25**: any cross-request authority cache is keyed on `(principal, org)` and invalidated by any
write to membership, role, grant, or scope.

**QA.** Tier A: no `sort()` over `org_id` on an authority path. Tier B: extend
`web/tests/admin/resolveAdminAccessCore.chooseOrg.test.ts` — the existing suite encodes the behaviour being
removed and must be rewritten deliberately, not deleted. Tier C: write an authority row, assert the next
request reflects it.
**Exit.** No authority decision depends on UUID ordering.

## 10. QA architecture

### 10.1 Four tiers

| Tier | Mechanism | Runs | Covers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A — static / build** | Build-time checks over the declared route table and schema assertions | Every build | I-1, I-3, I-5, I-6, I-7, I-8, I-9, I-12, I-13, I-14, I-15, I-16, I-17, I-24 |
| **B — unit** | Vitest over pure resolvers and gates, fabricated access contexts | Every commit | I-2, I-9, I-10, I-11, I-16, I-17, I-20 |
| **C — integration** | Vitest against a real database, `describe.skipIf(!hasEnv)` | Scheduled / pre-promotion | I-4, I-10, I-11, I-18, I-19, I-20, I-21, I-22, I-23, I-25 |
| **D — live / browser** | Authenticated Playwright on `:3020` | Lockout-class switches only | L1–L4 admission and scope behaviour |

The tiering is deliberate: **most invariants are cheapest at tier B**, because the codebase already has the
right shape for it. `web/tests/admin/usersRolesAuth.test.ts:6-19` builds an `AdminAccessContextSuccess` by hand
and asserts a pure function over it. Every capability, admission, and scope-dimension rule can be tested that
way in milliseconds. Tier C is reserved for what genuinely needs a database — transactional invariants
(I-18), fail-closed on absent data (I-19), and gate ordering (I-23).

Existing conventions to follow rather than reinvent, out of 2380 test files:

- Integration gating — `describe.skipIf(!hasEnv)` with an env-var guard, per
  `web/tests/admin/verticalBootstrap.integration.test.ts:12-18`.
- Live/perf tests — `*.live.test.ts` with an explicit `X_LIVE=1` opt-in so CI never depends on a local stack,
  per `web/tests/runtime/d1ProvisioningBudget.live.test.ts:14-24`.
- Heavy checks go through the broker: `alloy-validate wt6-vacilando-os-product-def typecheck|test|build|playwright`.
  Focused runs: `npx vitest run tests/access/<file>` from `web/`.

### 10.2 What is not a QA tier

**A grep or import-walk census is not verification.** `auditAuthorityPaths.mjs` reports 507 permission-gated
routes; 17 are. 490 of 507 are false positives, because `/permissionKeys\b/` cannot distinguish resolving a
permission set from consulting it, and `if (best.tier === 3) return best` stops the walk at the first mention
(`auditAuthorityPaths.mjs:37,103`).

No exit criterion in this plan is satisfied by a grep count. W-14's declared table exists precisely so that
conformance is a lookup. **W-14 retires the script**; until then, its output may not be cited as evidence in
any workstream.

Second methodological rule, carried from phase 2 §12: **a passing route census proves nothing about scope.**
G-C and G-D are independent — a route can gate capability correctly and read the whole org. Capability
coverage and scope coverage are reported as two numbers, never one.

### 10.3 The fixture matrix

One shared matrix of principals, defined once and reused by tiers B, C and D. It is what "prove zero
divergences" in §2 is measured against, and what W-21 asserts twice.

| Fixture | Roles | Grants | Scope | Exercises |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | `admin` | full | dept `all`, site `all` | the common case; regression baseline |
| F2 | `ops` | partial | dept `all`, site `restricted` | site enforcement (the leg that works) |
| F3 | `regional_lead` | `portal.access` granted | dept `restricted` | D2; I-16 admitting a non-legacy role |
| F4 | `school_director` | no `portal.access` | dept `restricted` | refusal path; W-1's exposure |
| F5 | `ops` + `regional_lead` | union | dept `restricted` | I-10 union semantics |
| F6 | membership, **no profile row** | any | — | I-19 deny-on-absent |
| F7 | `user_profiles.role` only, no `user_roles` | — | — | I-2; W-20's Q2 population |
| F8 | memberships in two orgs | differing | differing | I-7; no lexicographic tiebreak |
| F9 | `settings.users_roles`, not `admin` | that key | any | I-11 ceiling and self-elevation |
| F10 | service-role client, no principal | — | — | I-3 |

F6, F7 and F10 encode *defects* — they must resolve to denial after their workstream lands, and each is a
regression lock (§13). Build the matrix in **wave 1**, before it is needed, so waves 2–5 inherit it. It is the
single highest-reuse artifact in the plan.

### 10.4 Per-wave exit gates

No wave closes without: its tier A checks in CI · its tier B suite green · its tier C suite run and recorded ·
lockout-class workstreams carrying tier D evidence (route, steps, expected vs observed, console errors,
evidence path) · migrations accounted per §11 · regression locks registered.

---

## 11. Migration register and the apply gate

Migrations introduced by this plan, against `supabase/migrations/` (289 files today):

| # | Workstream | Migration | Target | Preflight focus |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | W-6 | Backfill access profiles for memberships lacking one | shared | Row count == W-0 Q4; no existing profile modified |
| M2 | W-5 | Atomic membership+profile RPC | shared | Function only; no data effect |
| M3 | W-9 | Catalog consolidation — repoint grants to one FK | shared | Every grant satisfies the surviving FK; no unexpected incoming FKs or dependent views |
| M4 | W-9 | Drop retired catalog tables (**separate, later**) | shared | Zero readers proven since M3 |
| M5 | W-11 | Catalog reconciliation — add enforced keys, delete unenforced | shared | Enumerated deletion list reviewed by the operator first |
| M6 | W-12 | `seed_default_rbac()` enumerates grants | shared | Catalog width vs live — a new tenant must not silently get a thinner set |
| M7 | W-13 | Seed `portal.access` and grant it | shared | Every org with an `admin`/`ops` membership receives the grant (W-0 Q5) |
| M8 | W-16 | Remediate undefined `user_roles.role` values | shared | Equals W-0 Q3; each row's disposition reviewed |
| M9 | W-16 | FK `user_roles.role` → `role_definitions` | shared | Zero violating rows after M8 |
| M10 | W-19 | Remove dead `owner`/`manager` RLS grants *(if D4=b)* | shared | No policy loses its only grant |

**Every one targets `shared`.** Per [`MIGRATION-APPLY-GATE.md`](../../MIGRATION-APPLY-GATE.md), each therefore
requires a **read-only preflight on the target database before the operator is asked to authorize anything**,
with `migrations[].preflight = { ok: true, summary, evidence_path }` and JSON evidence under this QA directory.
A bare `awaiting_authorization` row is not a valid ask.

Two rules from that document bear directly on this plan:

- **Preflight `ok: true` does not auto-apply.** It unlocks the honest question — authorize, or keep deferred.
- **Accept ≠ authorize-apply.** A gate of `needs_operator` must not complete a phase or advance the spine, even
  in autonomous mode. That bug shipped once on Access & Roles Phase 0 (2026-07-29).

M3/M4 and M8/M9 are deliberately split across migrations: repoint before drop, remediate before constrain.
Combining either pair produces a migration that cannot be applied safely and cannot be reverted cleanly.

**This phase applies no migration and writes no SQL.** The register is a plan.

---

## 12. Decision gates

Phase 2 §14 raises four decisions. None blocks the model; each blocks specific work.

| Decision | Question | Blocks | Needed by | Phase 2 recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **D1** | Does a person ever become a principal? | Nothing in this plan | Not on the critical path | "Not yet" — adopt §4's rules now; they cost nothing and make an implicit link impossible later |
| **D2** | What are `regional_lead` and `school_director` for? | W-13 grants, W-17 | Before wave 4 | Grant them `portal.access`; under I-16 admitting them is configuration |
| **D3** | What is the delegation ceiling? | W-18 (**not** W-2) | Before wave 5 | No — subset rule plus self-elevation ban |
| **D4** | Is RLS an authority layer? | W-19 sizing | Before wave 5 scheduling | (b) not an authority layer, with (a) as a stated goal |

**D1 is genuinely not blocking**, which is worth stating plainly: phase 2 §4 specifies the rules that hold
whether or not the surface ships, so no workstream waits on it.

**D2 is on the critical path.** W-13 can ship behaviour-preserving without it — seed `portal.access` to
`admin` and `ops` only — but the workstream's *value* is admitting a third persona, and doing that later means
a second grant migration. Answering D2 before wave 4 costs one conversation; answering it after costs a
migration.

**D3 is deliberately split.** The self-elevation ban (W-2, wave 1) is not D3-dependent — no reading of D3
permits a principal to modify its own authority. Only the subset rule waits.

---

## 13. Regression locks

Each closed divergence gets one test that fails if it reopens. These are the locks, named, so a future
contributor deleting one has to do it on purpose.

| Lock | Asserts | Tier | From |
|---|---|---|---|
| **RL-1** | No route gates on `access.ok` alone | A + B | G2 / W-1 |
| **RL-2** | Every grid key exists in the catalog *(superseded by RL-3)* | B | C5 / W-3 |
| **RL-3** | The grid is generated; no literal key list in UI source | A | I-14 / W-10 |
| **RL-4** | Membership creation writes a profile row atomically | C | G4 / W-5 |
| **RL-5** | Absent profile denies; never `all` | C | I-19 / W-7 |
| **RL-6** | No role literal appears in `accessScope.ts` | A | C8 / W-8 |
| **RL-7** | Exactly one FK on `role_permission_grants.permission_key` | A | C3 / W-9 |
| **RL-8** | No `SELECT` over the catalog in a grant seed | A | G5 / W-12 |
| **RL-9** | No hard-coded portal role set (`PORTAL_ROLES`, `ALLOWED_ROLES`) | A | C6 / W-13 |
| **RL-10** | Every route file appears in the declared capability table | A | C1 / W-14 |
| **RL-11** | A principal cannot modify its own authority | B + C | G3 / W-2 |
| **RL-12** | No authority path reads `user_profiles.role` or `app_users.role` | A | §2.1 / W-20 |
| **RL-13** | Preview and runtime resolve identically across the fixture matrix | C | C11 / W-21 |
| **RL-14** | No `sort()` over `org_id` on an authority path | A | I-7 / W-22 |

RL-2 is listed *because* it is temporary: W-3 adds it and W-10 replaces it. An assertion that becomes
structurally unnecessary should be replaced deliberately, not quietly deleted when it starts failing.

### 13.1 Invariants with no workstream

All 21 rows of phase 2's divergence register are assigned above. Four invariants are not, because no phase 1
finding contradicts them. They are listed so that "unassigned" is a stated conclusion rather than an oversight:

| Invariant | Why no workstream | Still verified by |
|---|---|---|
| **I-4** — delegated-link tokens are expiring, single-use, org/subject/action-bound | `action_links` carries `expires_at` and `consumed_at`, and the consume route checks both, returning 410 for each (`web/app/api/action/[token]/consume/route.ts:24-29`, verified this phase). Phase 2 §3.4 states the properties as *required* so a future token type cannot ship with four of six | Tier C token tests (expiry, replay, cross-subject, cross-org) added alongside wave 1's fixture matrix |
| **I-5** — no implicit `persons` ↔ principal relation | The absence is the correct design (phase 2 §4.1), not a defect. Adopting §4.2's five rules costs nothing today | Tier A: no FK or join between `persons` and `auth.users`; no email/phone-based principal lookup |
| **I-6** — every authority decision is made against one explicit org | The one link of the chain enforced everywhere today (phase 1 §5). The model's only requirement is that it stay that way | Tier A: every authority query filters `org_id` |
| **I-21** — scope enforced symmetrically on reads and writes | `accessScope.ts` already provides all three families (list-filter, mutation assert, drawer-read assert). No finding shows asymmetry | Tier C integration matrix, per scoped entity, landing with W-15 |

I-4 and I-21 carry real test work even without a workstream; that work attaches to wave 1 (fixture matrix) and
W-15 (per-family sweep) respectively rather than standing alone.

---

## 14. Scope, risks, limits

### 14.1 Explicitly out of scope

Per the assignment constraints:

1. **Shipping Access & Identity UI.** An Access product surface already exists — four chapters at
   `/organization/access` (`users`, `roles`, `scopes`, `security`;
   `web/tests/access/accessProductUi.test.ts:22-35`). W-10 and W-21 modify existing surfaces so they tell the
   truth about the model. Neither ships a new experience.
2. **Rebuilding Users/Roles settings.** W-10's projection and W-17's multi-role write path change what those
   screens are backed by, not what they are.
3. **No product UI completeness claim.** Nothing in this document asserts that any Access & Identity UI is
   complete.
4. **No push, merge, or PR**, and **no migration applied**. §11 is a register, not an apply log.

### 14.2 Risks

| Risk | Where | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Operator lockout | L1–L4 | The §2 ritual — seed, dual-read, prove zero, switch — plus tier D evidence |
| Shared-DB migration damages grants | M3, M5, M9 | §11 preflight before the authorization ask; repoint-before-drop, remediate-before-constrain |
| W-15 stalls half-done and gets reported as complete | Wave 4 | Per-family counts published as they land; RL-10 makes incompleteness a build failure |
| Deleting unenforced keys surprises an operator | W-11 / M5 | The deletion list is reviewed **before** the migration, as an exit artifact |
| Waves 2 and 3 collide | Parallelism | Disjoint surfaces — scope tables and handlers vs catalog tables and the grid. If either widens, serialize. |
| The plan's own verification repeats C1 | Everywhere | §10.2 — no exit criterion is a grep count; W-14 retires the census script |

### 14.3 Limits

1. **Static and file-grounded**, like phases 1 and 2. No request was issued, no browser used, no live database
   queried, no source file modified. The only file written by this phase is this document.
2. **Sizings are estimates**, calibrated to 539 routes and 289 migrations, not measured. W-15 (L) has the
   widest error bar; W-4's exception baseline will sharpen it.
3. **Wave 0 is a plan for queries, not their results.** Every count it produces can reorder waves 2 and 5.
4. **Membership writers beyond `POST /api/admin/users` were not enumerated.** W-5 carries that audit as its
   first step; if other writers exist, W-5 grows.
5. **The observation window for dual-read is not specified.** It depends on real traffic to the authority path,
   which is a deployment fact this phase cannot see. Each lockout-class workstream sets its own and states it.
6. **No effort is budgeted for governance-doc reconciliation.**
   `docs/platform/governance/roles-and-permissions.md` is `status: canonical` and states a rule the code does
   not follow, with a dead "Expanded reference" pointer (phase 2 §15.6). It should land with W-15, and is not
   sized here.
